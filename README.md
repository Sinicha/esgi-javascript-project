Our project is to allow the management of an Escape Game. 
Players side, we can view days of reservation and specify the room to book.
On the agent side, they will be able to share room management.
During the parties in the premises, players will trigger sensors in their advanced or not if they are blocked.
Depending on that and the state of the game in time, the staff can trigger index sensors. 
At the end of the game, a score can be created for the players.
